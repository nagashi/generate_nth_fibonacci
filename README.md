Per Wikipedia,&nbsp;"In mathematics,&nbsp;the Fibonacci numbers,&nbsp;commonly denoted Fn,&nbsp;form a sequence,&nbsp;called the Fibonacci sequence,&nbsp;such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1".  
<p>

The initial program I wrote was based on the Binet formula,&nbsp;(see below),&nbsp;which is considered an exact formula for computing the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence.&nbsp;&nbsp;After testing the program,&nbsp;I found that the precision was off around an input of 50.&nbsp;&nbsp;The datatype used in the program was u128.&nbsp;&nbsp;I assumed the precision loss was due to two mathematical computations;&nbsp;computing the square root and division.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisified with the outcome,&nbsp;I decided to do a little more research.

 I came across an interesting article in Medium on [Memoization in Rust](https://medium.com/swlh/on-memoization-291fd1dd924) written by Andrew Pritchard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Memoization is an optimization technique which is used to speed up the result of a program by storing the result of a computation for the inputted value and then returning the the cached result when the same input occurs again.
 <br>
 <br>
 Using the Fibonacci example in the article,&nbsp;one issue I ran into,&nbsp;again,&nbsp;was the u128 dataype.&nbsp;&nbsp;In using the datatype on this approach,&nbsp;I would receive a panic message of 'attempt to add with overflow' when inputting a value greater than 186.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I could not figure out how to eloquently handle this error,&nbsp;I hardcoded a fix which I wasn't completely happy with:&nbsp;[see here on line 66](https://github.com/nagashi/nth_fibonacci/blob/main/src/main.rs)&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issued I found involved the formatting of the output.&nbsp;&nbsp;The formatting library used with the u128 datatype was not applicable for the BigUint datatype.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrapping this application,&nbsp;I decided the write a new one using the BigUint datatype and developed my own function to format the output into what I consider a more appealing form.&nbsp;&nbsp;The algorithm
constructed for this program is based on the display in the following gif file.

The way the program is now constructed satisfies my previous concerns:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Allowing the user a wider range of numbers to input.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest number I tried successfully was 1.6 million.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Format the sequence and, if needed, the input number.<br><br>The 'formated' function will now accept arguments of type u128 and BigUint.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately,&nbsp;it will also accept other datatypes as well that could/will cause a problem if the function body is not reconfigured.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not figure out how to have the function only accept an integer or bigint,&nbsp;but,&nbsp;that's where I am in my learning at this moment,&nbsp;at this time,&nbsp;as I travel through the land of Rust.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm confident that I'll pick up the knowledge and display remnants of improvement as I travel on down the road.
